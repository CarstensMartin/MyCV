                    <p>Driven by the need to make a difference in my clients’ lives and constantly benchmarking my
                        progress against the goals I set for myself,
                        I don’t sit still much. I am happiest when I’m cutting new deals with a client and finding
                        solutions to their problems.
                        My ability in Excel has contributed to much of my career success in being able to identify
                        problems and then create/implement solutions (such as fuel theft, forex, load planning, stock
                        reports etc.).
                        Speed of implementation is my key to success. I recently returned into the game of logistics and
                        I’m super hungry to learn, grow and excel in my career by always going the extra mile.
                        I’m looking for the next adrenaline fuelled opportunity to pursue my career growth. If you’re
                        looking for a mover and shaker let’s chat?</p>
